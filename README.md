VeilData: Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Financial Data Generator

Baseline Implementation using CTGAN:
- Implemented CTGAN using SDV in Google Colab
- Generated 500 synthetic records
- Compared synthetic vs real data distributions
- 
Observed Limitations:
- Identifier columns produced unrealistic values
- Numerical distributions showed deviations
- Minority categories not properly preserved
- No formal differential privacy guarantee

Future Work:
- Integrate differential privacy mechanisms
- Improve rare-category modelling
- Apply on digital lending and financial datasets
